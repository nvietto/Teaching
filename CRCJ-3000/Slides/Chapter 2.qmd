# Types of Variables and Levels of Measurement


# Let's Introduce (or reintroduce) Some Terms

## [Variable]{.grey}

[A characteristic that describes people, objects, or places and takes on [multiple]{.orange} values in a sample or a population]{style="color:#859ab2;"}.

<br> 

Or in short.... it is something that [varies]{.orange} or changes.

<br> 

Examples? Any guesses? 

* The amount of crime across different states.
* The number of water molecules between different lakes.
* The height differences between classmates.


## [Constant]{.grey}

[A characteristic that describes people, objects, or places and takes on [only one]{.orange} value in a sample or a population]{style="color:#859ab2;"}.

<br>

Or in short (again).... it is something the [does not]{.orange} vary. 

<br>

Examples? Any guesses? 

* Asking everyone in class if they are taking statistics... all the answers would be "Yes!" 
* Speed of light in vacuum (i.e., devoid of matter, like outer space) will always be exactly 299,792,458 m/s.
* The depth of Mariana Trench will always be 35,814 feet. 


## [Units of Analysis]{.grey}

[The object or target of a research study.]{.grey}

<br>

Or simply the [something]{.grey} that a researcher gathers or studies. 

<br>

In criminology our unit of analysis are usually [people]{.orange} like correctional officers, police officers, and judges.

<br>

We can also use a larger units of analysis, often called [systems]{.orange}, like correctional institutes, police departments, and courts.

## [Dependent Variables]{.grey}

[The phenomena that the researcher is studying, trying explain or predict.]{.grey}

<br>

Or more simply.... the [**outcome**]{.orange} that changes. 

<br>

Our most common dependent variable is..... what do you think? 

<br>

* Crime!!!!!!!!


## [Independent Variables]{.grey}


[A factor of characteristic that is used to try to explain or predict the dependent variable.]{.grey}

<br>

Or more simply... the characteristic that [**In**]{.orange}fluences

<br>

These range to all sorts of things (e.g., hunger, being inebriated, having mental disposition like psychopathy) and are most commonly the backbone of a theory. 


::: notes 

For example, strain theory... individuals engage in criminal behavior when they experience a [dis-junction between cultural goals and the legitimate means available to achieve those goals.]{.grey}  

So the independent variable is the inability to achieve goals legitimately and the dependent variable (or outcome) would be crime. 

:::: 

## [Empirical]{.grey}

[Having the qualities of being measurable, observable, or tangible.]{.grey}

<br> 

Empirical phenomena are detectable with senses such as touch, sight, or hearing and they give rise to questions about the underlying forces driving them. 

## Pop Quiz

<br> 

[Identify the correct choice after reading the question below.]{.grey}

<br> 

A police department collected data on gun crime incidents within each city in Nebraska, they hypothesized that a change would occur after the a recent protest within the city of Omaha. 

<br> 

What response best describe [gun crime incidents]{.orange}


A.) it is an independent variable and a constant  
B.) it is an independent variable and not a constant   
C.) it is the dependent variable and not a constant  
D.) it is the dependent variable and a constant

```



## Relationships Between Variables: A Cautionary Note 

[Independent and dependent variables are not synonymous with cause and effect.]{.grey}

<br>

An independent variable might be related (or correlated with) a dependent variable but this [does not]{.grey} mean that are causally related.



::: notes 

Correlation is not causation. Demonstrate this with a classroom example. 


:::

# Ok, then how do we determine a causual relationship? 

## What is a causal relationship? 

A Causal effect is when variation in one phenomena [the independent variable]{.orange} leads to variation in another phenomena [the dependent variable.]{.orange}.

<br>

<br>

$$ X-> Y$$



::: notes

Give them some time to chew on this question. 

For example, a student does well on an exam (effect) because they studied persistently throughout the course (cause). 

Another example, reducing scurvy in sailors with vitamin C intake. 


To establish casualty, **three** criteria must be met. 

1.) Temporal Ordering   
2.) Empirical Relationship (often called an association)
3.) A non spurious association

Let's discuss each in detail.

:::


## [Temporal Ordering or Time Order]{.grey} 

The independent variable must occur [prior]{.orange} to dependent variable.

<br>

:::

::: notes

We must ensure that variation in the IV came before variation in the DV - the cause must become before the presumed effect. 


For example, if our research question was 'does regular exercise lead to improved cardiovascular health in adults?'

Step 1: Researchers measure participants' cardiovascular health indicators, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and resting heart rate.

Step 2: Participants engage in a regular exercise program over the next six months.

Step 3: After the exercise intervention period, researchers measure participants' cardiovascular health indicators again.


So you wouldn't preform Step two first (the intervention) then measure a baseline, right? That would not make any sense. 


::: 



## [Empirical Relationship or Association]{.grey}

The independent and dependent variable must have some observed association. 

<br> 

In other words, if there is an change in [one variable (X)]{.orange}, there must be a change in [another variable (Y)]{.orange}.


::: notes

In order for X -> Y, X and Y must be associated. 

For example, if the we hypothesize there two be an association between an area of high crime and the individuals in that area to have higher ownership but we find there is no association, then we cannot interpret any causality. 

::: 


## [Non-spuriousness or Controlling for Confounders]{.grey}


The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is not the result of a third un-accounted variable. 

<br> 

This generally occurs due to [omitted variable bias]{.orange}. 

<br> 

For example, the association between an [increase in ice cream sales]{.orange} and [increase in crime]{.orange}. 


::: notes 

It might sometimes appear that X and Y are related - or even that X caused Y - when in reality, a third variable, Z is causing the change in both X and Y

## Levels of Measurement


[A variables specific type or classification.]{.grey} 

<br>

There are two classes of variables - [continuous]{.orange} or quantitative and [categorical]{.orange} or qualitative.

<br>

Wihtin the two classes there are [Four Levels:]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} 

1.) Nominal   
2.) Ordinal    
3.) Interval  
4.) Ratio  

::: notes 

Categorical variables are comprised of groups or classifications (e.g., gender) that contain **labels**

Continuous variables are made of **numerical values** that measure how much a particular characteristic a person or object contains.  

::: 


## Nominal Variables 

[Categorical]{.orange} level of measurement

![](Images/dogs.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: notes 

Values have [no mathematical interpretation.]{.orange}

Vary in kind or quality, not in amount.

Different kinds of dogs is a nominal variable. Even dog's name could be considered nominal. 

Ex. Gender, ethnicity, occupation, religious affiliation, or region of the country. 

:::

##  Ordinal Variables

[Categorical]{.orange} but acts quantitative because of rank. 

<br>

![](Images/HHI.png){fig-align="center"}



::: notes 

**Quantitative** level of measurement

Numbers assigned to cases specify the order, and enable us to make "greater-than" and "less-than" comparisons.

Household income displays a clear rank and values of less or more. 

:::


## Interval Variables

[Continuous]{.orange} but lacks a [fixed zero point]{.grey}.


![](Images/interval.png){fig-align="center"}

::: footer

image: Research Method 

:::


::: notes 

**Quantitative** level of measurement

The numbers indicate the value of a variable represent fixed measurement units.

That means the change in value from one unit to the next is equal and incremental. 

However, there is **no fixed zero point** (i.e., be below 0 degrees Celsius and into negative temperatures)

We can add and subtract these variables, but the ratios (i.e., "twice as hot") are not meaningful. 

::: 

## Ratio Variables 

[Continuous]{.orange} and has an [absolute zero point.]{.grey}


![](Images/ratio.png){fig-align="center"}





::: notes 

**Quantitative** level of measurement

Let's revisit our doggo example. Dog's weight and age would be perfect examples of ratio variable. There is an absolute zero, we can say one dog is twice the weight of another dog or twice as old. 

At the ratio level, numbers are fixed units AND there is an absolute zero point - where zero means there is none of the thing being measured.

- So on a ratio scale, 10 is two points higher than 8, and twice as much as 5.
- So we can add and subtract ratio numbers, as well as multiply and divide them.

:::


## Attributes of Measurements


[Mutually exclusive attributes]{.grey}

<br>

[Exhaustive attributes]{.grey}

<br>

![](Images/att.png){fig-align="center"}

::: footer

image: heflo

::: 


::: notes

These terms best link back to the ordinal slide. 

A variables attributes are **mutually exclusive** if every case can have only one attribute 

A variables attributes are **exhaustive** when every case can be classified into one of the categories. 

When these are present, every case corresponds to one and only one attribute 

:::


## Pop Quiz
