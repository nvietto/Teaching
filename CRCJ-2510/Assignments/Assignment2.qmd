install.packages("tidyverse")

install.packages("devtools")

install.packages("palmerpenguins")

remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary")

*Each install will take time to run, so wait until the red stop sign in the corner disappears*

# Load the packages 

*Once you finish installing, copy and paste this code below into the console and hit enter*

```{r}
#| message: false

library(devtools)

library(palmerpenguins)

library(tidyverse)


```


# Views the data sets. 

*Copy and paste each of the words below into the console to view the dataframes (i.e., the columns and rows of the data)*



```{r, results='hide'}

penguins

starwars

USArrests
```

# Analysis

*Copy and paste each code block into the console and screenshot the result. Be sure to use include the blue cloud symbol in each screenshot.*

![](Images/3.png)

*1.) Run the following code (copy and paste and hit enter) in the console and screenshot the table (will appear in the viewer on the right)*




```{r, results='hide'}


library(gtsummary)

tibble(penguins)

summary(penguins)

penguins |> 
  select(species, island, sex) |> 
  tbl_summary()



```



*2.) Run the following code in the console and screenshot the graph*


```{r, fig.show='hide'}

speciesmass <- starwars |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

speciesmass |> 
 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()


```


*3.) Run the following code in the console and screenshot the bar plot*

``` {r, fig.show='hide'}

USArrests |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = UrbanPop, y = Murder)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Percent urban population", y = "Murder arrests (per 100,000)")


```


# Submit the screenshots on canvas. 

## Congrats! Now you're a data scientist!
