1.) Let's imagine there are 6 football matches scheduled to occur in June and July, 3 of these matches will be outdoor and 3 indoor. Lionel Messi has both 75% chance of scoring inside and a 60% chance of scoring outside in each match.

Assuming that the matches are independent of each other, what is the probability that he will score in 0, 1, 2, or 3 matches both indoor and outdoor? Be sure to summarize each like I did in the slides.

2.) Using the data below calculate the standard deviation. Once you've calculated the standard deviation, you need to determine the z-score for a student who scored 77 points on the test using the calculated standard deviation and mean score of the data set.


```{r}
#| echo: false

mean_crime <- 71
sd_crime <- 15

set.seed(0525)
crime <- rnorm(10, mean_crime, sd_crime)

data <- data.frame(
  "Student" = paste0("Student", 1:10),
  "Grades" = round(crime, 0)
)

data

```
