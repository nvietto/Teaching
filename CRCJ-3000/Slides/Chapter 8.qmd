# Confidence Intervals 

## Terms 

[Point Estimate]{.blue} is a single value calculated from a sample of data that is used to estimate the value of [an unknown parameter of a population]{.blue}.

<br>

[Confidence Interval]{.blue} is a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

<br>

[Level of Confidence]{.blue} is a probability that the confidence interval actually captures a true value. 




::: notes

Point estimates can really be any type of statistic but for today we will just think of it as our mean. 

A confidence interval is a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter (like the average height of all women in Nebraska) with a certain level of confidence. 

* It's like saying "we are 95% confident that the real average height falls somewhere between this low value and this high value."

Higher confidence levels lead to wider intervals.

# Before we discuss confidence intervals, we need to learn about bootstrapping ðŸ¥¾


## Bootstrapping 

This is a technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by [repeatedly re-sampling from the observed data with replacement]{.orange}

![](Images3/boot.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

The term bootstrapping comes from the phrase "pull yourself up by your bootstraps."

Imagine taking your original data set and creating new samples by randomly drawing observations (with replacement) from the original data. 

Think of it like creating new samples by drawing data points out of a card deck then using that as data (finding a mean), then reshuffling, redrawing, plotting the data (e.g.m our mean), and repeating. 

::: 



## Bootstrap Example 

This is our sample.

$$(-5,0)*--*-*-*-*---(0,0)--\stackrel{\mu}{|}--*--*--*-*-- (5,0)$$

Then randomly pull 3 values, which becomes our data. 

$$(-5,0)---*-----(0,0) \stackrel{\mu}{|}----*-----*-- (5,0)$$

[Plot our mean]{.blue} then throw those values back in (i.e., replacement) and pull another 3. 


$$(-5,0)--------(0,0)----*--*-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-*---- (5,0)$$

Plot that mean and repeat! 

::: notes

This is usually done hundreds or thousands of times, each of which we are calculating a mean and recording it. 


::: 


## Bootstrap Example 

Eventually we will have tons of means (we only have 9 in our example here) but in reality we would have hundreds or even thousands huddled around a similar point on our number line. 

<br>


$$(-5,0)-\stackrel{\mu}{|}----\stackrel{\mu}{|}---(0,0)---\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}---\stackrel{\mu}{|}- (5,0)$$

<br>

Once we have these, we have robust estimates of a true mean within a sample. 

# Great, but what does this have to do with confidence intervals? 

## Confidence Intervals 

Well, when we bootstrapped we essentially created an [empirical]{.blue} sampling distribution.

<br>


$$(-5,0)-\stackrel{\mu}{|}----\stackrel{\mu}{|}---(0,0)---\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}---\stackrel{\mu}{|}- (5,0)$$

<br>

And as a result we can identify the [percentiles]{.orange} that corresponds to your desired [confidence level]{.orange}.

<br>

These percentiles from the bootstrap replicates become the [lower and upper bounds]{.blue} of what we will call a [confidence interval]{.green}.


## Confidence Intervals 


Now that we have this sampling distribution we can calculate our 95% confidence interval.

<br> 

Which simply means, we have a 95% certainty that our population mean will fall between the two [red]{.red} lines. 

<br>

And 5% of the time, our population mean could fall outside of that zone. 

<br>

$$(-5,0)-\stackrel{\mu}{|}--\stackrel{\mu}{|}---(0,0)---\color{red}\vert-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\color{red}\vert--\stackrel{\mu}{|}- (5,0)$$


::: notes

95% is the industry standard, although sometimes we use a 99% confidence interval. 

The red line closest to the zero will be our **lower bound** and the other red line will be our **upper bound** interval.

# Time for Math! ðŸ§®

## Confidence Interval


$$\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

<br>

$\bar{x}$ = sample mean

$z$ = confidence level 

$s$ = sample standard deviation

$n$ = sample size 

::: {.nonincremental}
- Large sample are $\geq 30$ 
- Small samples are $<30$
:::


::: notes

Mention that the  $SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is just the standard error

::: 


## Confidence Levels

## Confidence Level Example 

A researcher wants to estimate the average number of hours per week spent by employees in a certain company on remote work activities. 

They take a random sample of [80 employees]{.blue} and find that the average number of hours spent on remote work per week in the sample is [12 hours]{.blue}, with a standard deviation of [2 hours]{.blue}.

Calculate the [95% confidence interval]{.blue} for the average number of hours spent on remote work activities per week by all employees in the company.

## Confidence Interval Example 


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### 1) Find the z score

#### 2) Add known values to equation

#### 3) Calculate the SE or $$\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

#### 4) Multiple value from step 3 by our z value

#### 5) Subtract that from our $\bar{x}$ for our Lower Bound CI

#### 6) Add that from our $\bar{x}$ for our Upper Bound CI

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

$$\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

<br>

* [95% CI: 11.5613 $\leq$ $\bar{x}$ $\leq$ 12.4387]{.blue}

:::


:::


::: notes 

Sample size = 80

Sample mean = 12 hours

Sample standard deviation = 2 hours

Confidence level = 95% so the z score is 1.96

2/8.94 =  0.2238

SE = 1.96 * 0.2238

0.438648

95% CI: 11.5613 $\leq$ $\bar{x}$ $\leq$ 12.4387

## Confidence Interval for Small Samples

With smaller samples (n< 30) the [Central Limit Theorem does not apply]{.blue},so we use a different distribution called the [t distribution]{.orange}. 

<br> 

In order to locate our t-value, we have to locate the [degrees of freedom]{.blue}. 


## Degrees of Freedom

[The number of independent values that are simple allowed to vary within the calculation of a parameter]{.blue}. 

<br>

$$df = n - 1$$

n = sample size

<br> 

But why n-1? 

## n-1 with respect to Degrees of Freedom

Let's consider an example where 4 people are asked to pick a number that, when combined with the other members, will equal 50. 

* Person 1 chooses [10]{.orange}

* Person 2 chooses [20]{.orange}

* Person 3 chooses [10]{.orange}

* Person 4 chooses...... Oof they can't choose anything! They are [no longer free to vary]{.blue}. 

* They have to choose [10]{.blue} because the we want a sum that equals 50. 


## Confidence Interval for Small Samples

Once we have a df and our confidence level, we head to page 373 in our book or head to this [link](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf).

## Confidence Interval for Small Samples Example


A biology class wants to estimate the average length of a certain species of fish in a lake. 

They take a random sample of [15 fish]{.blue} and measure their lengths. The sample [mean length is 30 cm]{.blue}, and the sample [standard deviation is 4 cm]{.blue}.

Calculate the [95% confidence interval]{.blue} for the average length of this species of fish in the lake.


## Confidence Interval Example 


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}


#### 1) Find the df and our confidence interval and locate the t value

#### 2) Add known values to equation

#### 3) Calculate the SE or $$\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

#### 4) Multiple value from step 3 by our t value

#### 5) Subtract that from our $\bar{x}$ for our Lower Bound CI

#### 6) Add that from our $\bar{x}$ for our Upper Bound CI

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

$$\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm t \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

* [95% CI: 27.781 $\leq$ $\bar{x}$ $\leq$ 32.219]{.blue}



:::

:::


::: notes 

Sample size  = 15

Mean = 30 cm

Standard deviation = 4 cm

Confidence level = 95% or 0.05

df = 14 and CL is 0.05 which leads to a t of 2.145

SE = 4/3.872 â‰ˆ 1.0334

2.145 * 1.0334 = 2.219 

95% CI: 27.781 $\leq$ $\bar{x}$ $\leq$ 32.219
