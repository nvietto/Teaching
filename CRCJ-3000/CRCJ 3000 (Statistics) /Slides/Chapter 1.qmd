# Introduction to Statistics 


::: notes 

Engage class in asking "What do statistics have to do with criminal justice?"

:::

## Why do we care? 

Statistics is the *backbone* of criminology and criminal justice. 

* Number of arrests **per** year
* Number of crimes in each city 
* Number of officers within a precinct
* [Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)](https://bjs.ojp.gov/)
* [FBI's Uniform Crime Report](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019)
* [**What and/or where else in criminology and criminal justice ?**]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

::: notes 

Discuss why statistics matters in crcj

Break down arrest per year on the board. 

* any time you see "per" in a sentence I want you to think of *division*

* For example, miles **per** hour.

## Arrests Rate 

One of the most common statistics used in criminology and criminal justice. 

<br>

It signifies the number of people arrested within a population during a certain time frame - usually in a given year. 

<br>


$$Arrest Rate = (Number of Arrest/Total Population) x Multiplier$$ 

::: notes 

A crime rate is calculated by dividing the number of reported crimes by the total population. The result is then multiplied by 100,000.

For example, in 2014 there were 48,000 robberies in California and the population was 38,000,000. Then we take 0.00126 and multiple it by our multiplier (100,000). This then equals a robbery crime rate of 126.4 per 100,000

* Our multiplier is determined by our **population size**. For example, if we have a large population (millions) we'd use 100,000

* If you city is smaller (e.g., a rural town) we would likely use 1,000.

# Where else do you see or use statistics? 

::: notes 

Let them answer. Encourage with maybe fantasy football or something

# Let's review some basic terms 


## {background-image="images/science.png"}

[is the process of gathering and analyzing data in a systematic way using procedures (i.e., [methods]{style="color:#859ab2;"}) that are accepted across a discipline.]{.absolute bottom=0.05}

## Sample vs. Population

* Any guesses? 

<br>

* A [Population]{style="color:#859ab2;"} is the universe of people, objects, or locations that researchers wish to study. 

<br>

* A [Sample]{style="color:#859ab2;"} is a subset pulled from the population in order to make generalizations about the universe of people, objects, or locations within that population. 


## Pop Quiz! 

Which of the following is a sample? 

<br>

a.) The number of women in the University  

b.) The number of prisoners within a prison

c.) All of the people in the state of Michigan.

d.) A group of 100 police officers pull from a department


## Replication 

Thoughts? 

<br>

Why would a statistics book emphasize [replication]{style="color:#859ab2;"}? 

<br>

* [Replication]{style="color:#859ab2;"} is conducted for the purpose of determining if a study's results hold when a new sample measures a previous study's findings.

Allow them to have time for input before final point reveal

## Hypothesis and Theories 


[Theory]{style="color:#859ab2;"} is a set of **proposed and testable** explanations about reality that are bound together by evidence.  

<br>

[Hypothesis]{style="color:#859ab2;"} a **single proposition** deduced from a theory, that must hold true in order for the theory itself to be considered valid. 


::: notes 

Expand on this with strain theory

**Strain theory** posits that individuals engage in criminal behavior when they experience a disjunction between cultural goals and the legitimate means available to achieve those goals.

Hypothesis 1: "Individuals experiencing economic strain are more likely to engage in property crimes than those with stable economic conditions."

This **hypothesis** is specific and can be tested through empirical research to examine the relationship between economic strain and property crime rates.

## Types of Scientific Research

[Evaluation Research]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

* Examines the results of program to assess whether the programs are effective

[Exploratory Research]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

* Examines issues that have been understudied and thus lack theoretical or empirical grounding

[Descriptive Research]{style="color:#859ab2;"}   

* Studies done for the purpose of describing a phenomena that occurs in a population 



::: notes 

Let them guess what each is then expand on it 

**Eval**

* Why would we care if programs are effective or not?  

**Explore**

* What are some examples of an unstudied phenomena? 


**Descriptive** 

* This is common within victimization research, e.g., describing the tragedy of missing and murdered indigenous women each year.

## Software for Statisitical Analysis 

We will touch lightly on software in this class. 

Specifically, we will be using R through Posit Cloud. 

But we won't dive into that until later in the semester.
