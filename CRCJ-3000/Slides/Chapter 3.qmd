## Examples of a Univariate Statistic 

[Frequency distribution]{.grey}


![](Images/Univar.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

This is a **frequency distribution**, which is a raw count of the # of times a particular characteristic appears in a data set. 

How many variable do you see? 

Hint: Variable will be located on the x and y axis. Since this is a frequency distribution, we only have one variable. 



::: 



## Examples of a Univariate Statistic 

[Proportion (p)]{.grey}

<br>

[$p = f / n$]{.absolute top=300 left=400 width="350" height="300"}

<br>

<br>

f = raw frequency 

n = total sample size

::: notes

A standardized form of a frequency that ranges from 0 to 1. 

We use standardized forms in statistics for a number of reasons, but the most common is to improve interpretability. Taking a raw score and converting it to a 0-1 scale just makes the picture (i.e., the model's results) clearer. We will get into this more-so in Chapter 4. 

When a proportion score is 0.00, this indicates a complete absence of a given characteristics (i.e., f = 0.)  

Conversely, when the proportion score is reflection of the denominator (i.e., the exact number of N), a given characteristic will have a proportion of 1.00 and therefore consume the entire sample.  

Although, these are the extremes of the situations, and a sample will likely be somewhere in between.

## Examples of a Univariate Statistic 

[Percentage (pct)]{.grey}

<br>

[$p = (f / n)100$]{.absolute top=300 left=400 width="350" height="300"}

<br>

<br>

f = raw frequency 

n = total sample size

::: notes 


The percentage is simply just a proportion score multiplied by 100. 

Essentially,  we are just re-scaling the proportion to fall within a range of 0-100. We do this because this is more readable to the public. 


::: 


## Examples of a Univariate Statistic 

[Rate (r)]{.grey}

<br>

[$r = (f/N)Multiplier$]{.absolute top=300 left=400 width="350" height="300"}

<br>

<br>

f = frequency

N = population

Multiplier = determined by our population size (e.g., if your population is millions, you'd use 100,000)

* What would you use if your populations is smaller? For example, a rural town of 15,000.

::: notes 

Rate is a method of standardizing an event of interest by the total population. For example, rate per 100,000 or 10,000 or 1000

::: 


## Let's do some calculations



![](Images/calc.png){fig-align="center"}





::: notes

Now that we understand some terms, lets calculate some rates. 

**Calculate the rate for each row, then convert each rate into a standardization of per 10,000 people.** 

Remember rate is: f/population 

Then standardize it by converting that value into the that makes it intrepretable per 10,000 people.

## Contingency Tables

<br>

The top [Columns]{.orange} and furthest left [Rows]{.orange} are our variables.

::: notes


Walk through the table, make sure they understand this. 

These will contain our **independent** and **dependent** variables. 

The variables simple overlap and interact in that fashion.

# Graphs and Charts 



## Pie Charts 

Used for [categorical variables]{.grey} with only a few groups. 

```{r}

library(plotrix)

values <- c(2,4,6,8)

labels <- c("We hate\n pies","We oppose\n pies","We don't\n care","We just love pies")


lp<-pie3D(values,
          radius = 0.8,
          theta = 1.0,
          labels = labels ,
          explode=0.05)


```

::: notes

Ask what are the two types of categorical varibles (Nominal and ordinal)


::: 


## Adding Data to Pies

Adding [percentages]{.grey} to pie charts 


```{r}


library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(palmerpenguins)

data <- penguins |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(counts = n()) 
 
  
plot_ly(data, 
  labels = ~ species,
  values = ~ counts,
  type = 'pie',
  hole = 0.4,
  sort = F,
  textinfo = "label",
  direction = "clockwise",
  title = "<b>Species of Penguins</b>",
  showlegend = F)



```

::: notes 

Problems with pie charts 

* Humans are not great at interpreting angles, this is clear when compare multiple pie charts 

![](Images/pies.png)

* If you have a lot of categories, you will have trouble interpreting 

* Small percentages are difficult to see

##  Bar Graphs


Used for [categorical]{.grey} variables that have many or a few groups. 

<br>

```{r}


library(plotly)
library(palmerpenguins)

data <- penguins |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(counts = n()) 

fig <- plot_ly(data, 
               x = ~species,
               y = ~counts,
               type = 'bar')

fig <- fig|> 
  layout(title = "Number of Species in Palmer Penguins Data Set",
         xaxis = list(title = " "),
         yaxis = list(title = "Count"))

fig

```

## Histograms 

Used for [continuous]{.grey} variables

```{r}


library(plotly)

set.seed(021424)

fig <- plot_ly(type='histogram',
  x=~rnorm(100, 5),
  bingroup=1)

fig <- fig |> 
  add_trace(
  type='histogram',
  x=~rnorm(30, 5),
  bingroup=1)

fig <- fig |> 
  layout(barmode="overlay",
  bargap= 0.2)

fig





```

::: footer

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/histograms/)

::: 


::: notes

Ask what are the variables that can be continuous (ratio and interval). 


:::


## Frequency Polygon

Used for [continuous]{.grey} variables.

<br>

Alternative to a histogram. 

<br>

```{r}

set.seed(021424)

pos1 <- rpois(10000, lambda = 6)

hist_data <- hist(pos1, 
                  plot = FALSE)

# Plot the frequency polygon
plot(hist_data$mids,
     hist_data$density,
     type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "#859ab2", 
     main = "Frequency Polygon", xlab = "Values", ylab = "Density")

```


::: notes

Show them what the shape of a polygon is if they do not know, could help with associations 

::: 

## Line Charts 

These are common for [longitudinal]{.grey} variables or [trends]{.grey}.

<br>

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

set.seed(021424)

data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(50, 8),
  y = rnorm(50, 3)
)


ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.5) +  
  geom_point(color = "orange", size = 2) +    
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Years and Cost", 
       x = "Years", y = "Cost") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))





```

::: notes 


**Longitudinal** variables that are measured repeatedly over time

Briefly mention the difference between cross-sectional and longitundinal 


**Trends** patterns that indicate whether something is increasing or decreasing or staying constant over time.
