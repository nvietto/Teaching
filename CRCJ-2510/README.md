This is a course on research methods within criminology and criminal justice. 

Course content adapted from https://jnix.netlify.app/courses/crcj2510/

Additionally, the image folders contains all .png files for the entire course, so that needs to be added into your project file for everything to run smoothly. You can just clone the repo, which may be the easiest option. 

I was learning Quarto/revealjs as I made these, so they get better with time. I will eventually update the older weeks.
