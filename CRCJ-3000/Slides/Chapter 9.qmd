# Hypothesis Testing


## Inferential Analysis

[Inferential statistics]{.blue} is the use of a sample to make reasonable guesses about the larger population.

::: notes 

As I mentioned in many lectures, you can only acquire data from samples, because it is too difficult or expensive to collect data from the whole population

## Confidence Intervals

Let's refresh our what we know about CIs.

<br>

Recall we have a 95% certainty that our population mean will fall between the two [red]{.red} lines. 

And 5% of the time, our population mean could fall outside of that zone.


$$(-5,0)-\stackrel{\mu}{|}--\stackrel{\mu}{|}---(0,0)---\color{red}\vert-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\stackrel{\mu}{|}-\color{red}\vert--\stackrel{\mu}{|}- (5,0)$$


Any values within the confidence intervals were [reasonable estimates of the population parameter]{.blue} and any values outside of the confidence intervals [were not reasonable estimates]{.orange}. 



::: notes 

Although, there's a more formal method for testing whether a given value is a reasonable value of a population parameter

## Hypothesis Testing 

We'll spend some time on both of these concepts, as they can be difficult to understand.

<br>

[[N]{.aqua}ull Hypothesis]{.blue} there is [n]{.aqua}o difference in the populations parameter you are testing within your sample. 

<br>

[Alternative Hypothesis]{.blue} there is a difference in the population parameter you are testing within your sample.  



## Null Hypothesis $H_0$

If this is true, it suggests that [any changes are because of random chance]{.blue} and not because of a relationship between variables. 

<br>

If this is false, it suggests that we can [reject the $H_0$]{.blue2} and [accept our alternative hypothesis]{.blue}.

<br>

It's important to understand, that we are only [[reject the $H_0$]{.blue2} , and [not confirming anything]{.orange}, other than the relationship expressed in the null is not occurring within our sample.]{.blue}


## Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$

This is essentially what we are looking (the goal of the study) for within our sample.


<br>

We only adopt the this, if [we have rejected the $H_0$]{.blue} hypothesis. 

<br>

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1.) [Define or frame]{.orange} our null and alternative hypothesis 

<br>

2.) [Decide on our test statistic and significance level]{.blue} (We'll get here over the upcoming weeks)

<br>

3.) Decide on our [sampling distribution]{.blue}

<br>

4.) Do the math ðŸ§®

<br>

5.) Then ask, [do we reject or retain the null?]{.blue2} 


## Framing our Hypothesis Example 1

Let's consider an example involving the mean weight [loss]{.orange} of a new diet program that suggest a 5 pound weight loss within a three days.

<br>

$H_0$: The [mean (our population parameter)]{.blue} weight loss for the individuals within our sample will have [no]{.red} change or they'll add on weight. 

<br>

$H_A$: The mean weight loss for the individuals within our [sample will be 5 pounds or greater]{.green}. 



::: notes

$H_0$: In other words, after completing the diet program (three days later), the weight will either be the same or they will have gained more weight. 

$H_A$: In other words, after completing the diet program (three days later), the weight will either be 5 pounds or greater. 
::: 

## Framing our Hypothesis Example 2

Let's consider a new medication that is alleging to reduce blood pressure in men a week after taking it. 

<br>

$H_0$: The mean reduction in blood pressure for patients taking the new medication is [equal to 0 mmHg (no change) or worsen blood pressure]{.blue}.

<br>


$H_A$: The mean [reduction]{.green} in blood pressure for patients taking the new medication is [greater]{.green} than 0 mmHg.


## Type 1 & Type 2 Error

Type [I]{.orange} = False [P]{.orange}ositive 

#### Rejecting a true null hypothesis 



Type [II]{.aqua} = False [N]{.aqua}egative

#### Retaining a false null hypothesis
