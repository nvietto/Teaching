## Course Description

The primary goal of this course is to facilitate your growth as both consumers and producers of research. We will explore a variety of methodologies (e.g., survey research/self-report, official stats/secondary data, quasi-experimental design, etc.) used in criminological and criminal justice research. Further, we will evaluate these methodologies within the context of design concerns such as: research purpose, operationalization, validity, reliability, and ethics.

## Textbook and Resources

## Assignments, Exams, and Grading

There will be three exams over the course of the semester, comprised of multiple choice and short-answer questions drawn from the assigned readings and class discussions.
