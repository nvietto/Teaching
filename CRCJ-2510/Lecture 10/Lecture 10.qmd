## Analyzing Content 
### What are secondary data? 

Surveys, official statistics, official records, historical documents

## Analyzing Content 
### Historical Events Research

*Seek to develop general theoretical explanation of historical events and process instead of just detailed, "fact centered" descriptions of them.*

<br>

Eric Rise's study of the [*Martinsville Seven*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinsville_Seven), called *The Martinsville Seven: Race, Rape, and Capital Punishment* is an example of historical events research. 


::: notes 

The Martinsville Seven were a group of seven African-American men from Martinsville, Virginia, who were all executed in 1951 by the state of Virginia after being convicted of raping a white woman.  

Most of them were between the ages of 18-23.  

They were quickly tried in six separate trials (two agreed to be tried together), and each was convicted and sentenced to death.  

It was the largest mass execution for rape that had been reported in the United States.  

They were eventually pardoned in August of 2021 for not recieving adequate due process.   

Rise found that capital sentencing disparities existed between White and Black during the appeals of the seven.

### Comparative Methods

Examining data through comparsion of many geographical entities. 

**Two Types:**

* [Descriptive comparative research]{style="color:#007BB8;"}


* [Analytic comparative research]{style="color:#007BB8;"}


::: notes 

**Descriptive comparative research** seeks to understand the structure, nature, or scope of a nation's or nations criminal justice system or rates of crime 

**Analytic comparative research** seeks to understand how national systems work and the factors related to their operations

**Case Study: Homicide Across Nations**

Comparative Crime Data File (CCDF)

* 1984 
* 110 nations 
* 44 major international cities covering 1900 - 1970s

[Archer & Gartner (1984)]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Examined if war increase the level of homicide within a nation once a war ends. 
* Why would this occur? Any thoughts*
* Using CCDF, found that most nations experienced a *increase* in their rates of homicide following both small and large wars.

::: notes 

One theory - social solidarity model - posit a decrease in violence bc a social solidarity after a war.  

Another - the legitimization of violence model - postulates a lasting reduction of inhibitions against human life and thereby increase levels of violence.

::: notes 

For example, researchers can evaluate language used within a news article to search for bias or partiality.

Used to learn about popular culture by studying characteristics of messages delievered through the mass media and other sources. 

Primary goal is to analyze text. 

Machine learning (deep learning) is bigger in this area now more than ever. Talk about the deep learning project for predicting moving rating using text reviews on imbd. 

Steps to begin this analysis: (on p.212)

* Identify a populatin of documents or other textual sorces for study 
* Determine the unit of analysis 
* Select a sample of units from the population 
* Design coding procedure for variables 
* Test and refine the coding procedures 
* Base statistical analysis on counting occurrences of items.

::: notes 

The process of using a geo-graphic information system, to conduct special analysis of crime problems and other police related issues. 

*Three main functions:*

1.) Provides visual and statistical analyzes of the spatial nature of crime  
2.) Links crime data to other data sources, (e.g., census and schools), to be established   
3.) Helps visually communicate analysis results

## Methodological Issues 

In secondary data there are often methodological issues. 

* Historical events and comparative research often have a small number of cases, spotty historical records, different cultures and linguistic contexts. 

* Uncertainty about the methods used in data collection 

* Missing data 



::: notes 

Researchers should ask the following questions when looking into secondary data. 

* What are the agency's goals in collecting the data? 

* Who was responsible for the data collection and what were their qualification? 

* What data were collected and what were they intended to measure? 

* When was the information collected? 

* WHat methods were used for data collection? 

* How is the information organized? 

* What is known abou the success of the data collection?

## Missing Data

This occurs when participants skip question within a survey.

::: notes 

This becomes a major problem when you have hundreds or thousands of cases and missing values accumulate.  

This reduces the chance of drawing reliable inferences from the study.

## Ethical Issues

Be honest and responsible in working out arragnements for data access and protection.

::: notes 

Researchers who conclude that they are being denied access to public records of the federal government may be able to obtain the data by filing a freedom of information act request.   

This allows all persons to have a right to access federal agency records.
