## [**Why care about statistics?**]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

<br>

Statistics can be a vehicle that leverages complex machinery to help you reach new destinations (conclusions) not otherwise accessible.

::: notes 

Just like with cars, personality and preferences can shape which model you choose to get to a destination. 

This course will teach you the basics of learning how to drive the 'car.'

## [**Why care about statistics?**]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

[Statistics is skill-based!]{style="color:#859ab2;"} 

<br>

And like any skill (e.g., playing piano, learning a new language, dribbling a ball), it requires practice, practice, and even more practice.

## Class Structure

-   Slides will be available on Canvas (Files/Lecture Slides) after we cover each chapter. 
    -   Everything you [*need*]{style="color:#859ab2;"} to know is **not** in the slides
-   Each lecture will be conducted with open discussion and participation is expected. 

## How will you be Graded?

-   Exams (multiple-choice and problem sets)

-   Homework (submit your hand written calculations)

-   Participation 

## My Expectations

-   [**Read**]{style="color:#859ab2;"}

-   [**Show up to class**]{style="color:#859ab2;"}

    -   This material is cumulative (i.e., it snowballs) and missing lectures will impede your understanding of the material
    -   If missing class is unavoidable, let me know.

-   [**Participate**]{style="color:#859ab2;"}

## Academic Honesty 

I encourage you all to work together on assignments, however submitted assignments should be done individually and should be written in your own words. 

<br> 

Exams will be completed in-person, so I will know if you cheat (e.g., ChatGPT) on your homework.

<br> 

ChatGPT (or any LLM) is a tool that I encourage you to use if you get stuck on something or need clarification [**but**]{style="color:#859ab2;"} copy and pasting from it is plagiarism and I will treat it as such. 

## Participation & Climate

-   Inclusive environment
    -   This class can & should be a place for [*active*]{style="color:#859ab2;"} discussions. This is where learning ['comes to life.']{style="color:#859ab2;"}
-   Consider the discussion ['space']{style="color:#859ab2;"} you take up
    -   Allow others to speak.
        -   If you find yourself taking up most of the discussion, take a break & give room for others to participate.
    -   This space is for all of us.

## Office Hours

-   A couple options:

    -   Talk to me after class

    -   We can set up a time on Zoom

## Technology in the Classroom

- Learning requires [*intense*]{style="color:#859ab2;"} attention.
    - Focusing without distraction, allows your *specific* brain circuits to strengthen which 'cements' the skill.
    
    - If you are distracted or *'task switching,'* you will have too many circuits firing to promote optimal learning.

::: notes

Task switching - When you switch from one task to another, there is a 'residual' of your attention â€“ you cannot fully focus on the new task. - For example: checking emails, social media, texts, etc. then switching back to the lecture, you still have that 'residual' attention there and you cannot fully focus on the task in front of you (i.e., the lecture).
