## Research Report Goals
### What is a research report? 

A [**research report**]{style="color:#FFA500;"} presents findings and interpretations in a way that reflects some combination of the researcher's goals, the research sponsor's goals, the concern's of the research subjects and the concerns of a wider anticipated readership.

## Research Report Goals
### Advancing Scientific Knowledge


::: columns

::: {.column}


Reports are directed to other social scientist working in a similar area of study. From there, replication or advancement of the findings occurs.

## Research Report Goals
### Replication Crisis 


The [**replication crisis**]{style="color:#FFA500;"} is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are **difficult or impossible to reproduce**. Learn more about it [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis)

Expand on this a bit but keep it light.

## Research Report Goals
### Shape Social Policy 


::: columns

::: {.column}

Social policy reports not only focus on the results of a study but also [*address the policy implications of the findings*]{style="color:#FFA500;"}.  

An example of this can be found in one our fields flagship journals - [*Criminology & Public Policy *](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17459133)

## Research Report Goals
### Organize Social Action 

[**Participatory Action Research (PAR)**]{style="color:#FFA500;"}

Those whom are impacted by research are the ones taking the lead in framing the questions, the design, methods, and the modes of analysis of such research projects.

::: notes 

Brings researchers into closer contact with participants in the research settings. 

The key feature of PAR Research can be summarized as "a spiral of self-reflecting cycles" involving:

* Planning a change  
* Acting and observing the process and consequences of the change   
* Replanning   
* Acting and observing again

## Types of Research Reports 
### Student Papers and Theses 

Audience is a professor or a committee of professors which form a **thesis committee**.

This occurs at the graduate level - MA, MS, PhD.

## Types of Research Reports 
### Journal Articles

[**Peer Review**]{style="color:#FFA500;"} 

A journal's editor sends the article to two or three experts (peers), who are asked to examine the study and decided if the study should be published.

Contains a process of revise and resubmit (R&R), which likely occurs 2-3 times. 

The process is anonymous.

## Types of Research Reports 
### Journal Articles


::: columns

::: {.column}

A journal article contains the following sections: 

[Abstract]{style="color:#FFA500;"}  
[Introduction]{style="color:#FFA500;"}   
[Literature Review]{style="color:#FFA500;"}  
[Method]{style="color:#FFA500;"} 
[Results]{style="color:#FFA500;"}  
[Discussion]{style="color:#FFA500;"}  
[References]{style="color:#FFA500;"} 

[Here](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/nse/commkit/journal-article-introduction/) is a good resource to learn more.

## Types of Research Reports 
### Applied Reports

::: columns

::: {.column}

These are commissioned by a particular government agency, corporation, or nonprofit organization.  

Here at UNO we have the [Juvenile Justice Institute](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/juvenile-justice-institute/index.php)

## Ethics and Reporting 

<br>

* Provide an honest account of how the research was carried out and what the initial research question was.  
* Maintain a full record of the research project
* Avoid 'lying with statistics' or use misleading graphs  
* Acknowledge the sponsors of the research 
* Be sure that order of authors reflects the contribution 


::: notes

## Exam Details 

Exam will be in this classroom on 12/12/23 at the normal class time.

Not cumulative. Just focus on the content we covered in this module (i.e., chapters 9-12)

Any questions? 



## Course Evaluations

<br>

There will be two on Canvas (The UNO one should be in your email too). 

<br>

**Please wait till I leave the room.**



## Thank you
