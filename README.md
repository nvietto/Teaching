# Teaching

This repo contains course material for the classes I have taught. It also provides access to my R tutorials. 

To recreate a syllabus document as a PDF you need to have TinyTex installed and loaded. 

``` r
install.packages("tinytex")  
library(tinytex)
```

Additionally, my lectures and tutorials are created using Quarto in RStudio. For a tutorial on Quarto go <a href = "https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html" >here</a>.
