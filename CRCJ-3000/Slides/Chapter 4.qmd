# Measures of Central Tendency

## Measures of Central Tendency

Descriptive statistics that offer information on where the scores in a data set tend to cluster.

<br>

Examples: [Mean]{.orange}, [Median]{.orange}, [Mode]{.orange}.

::: notes

Describes where the majority of scores within a data set reside.

Often summarized by asking, "Where is the middle?"

:::

## The Mean

[The arithmetic average of a variable within a set of data.]{.aqua}

<br>

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$

$\bar{x}$ = Mean

$\sum$ = Summation

$x$ = Values in a column

$n$ = Sample size

## A Mean Example

We have five college student's test scores on a particular exam:


```{r}

data <- data.frame(
  grades = c(
  student_1 = 85,
  student_2 = 90,
  student_3 = 75,
  student_4 = 86,
  student_5 = 91
))

data

```

$$\bar{x} = \frac{(85 + 90 + 75 + 86 +91)}{5}$$
<br>

$$\bar{x} = ?$$



## The Median

A score that cuts a distribution in half, or more simply, the true [middle number]{.orange}.

<p style="text-align:center;"><u>Steps to Find the Median</u></p>


::: {#fig-simple}

```{dot}

graph {
  rankdir=LR;
  Sort -- Count;
  Count -- Odd;
  Count -- Even;
  Odd -- Method_One;
  Even -- Method_Two;
}
```

:::



::: notes


Describe why you'd use a median

1.) Sort the values in ascending order

2.) Count the number of values


:::

## Odd Number (Method One)

<br>

We only need one step for this!

<br>

$$Median = \frac {n + 1}{2} $$

$n$ = Sample size


## Even Number (Method Two)

LM and UM are numbers within the column.

Step 1

$$Lower Middle (LM) = \frac {n}{2} $$


Step 2

$$Upper Middle (UM) = \frac {n}{2} +1 $$

Step 3

$$Median = \frac {LM + UM}{2}$$

## Method One Example

We have nine college student's test scores on a particular exam:

<br>


```{r}

data <- data.frame(
  grades = c(
  student_1 = 85,
  student_2 = 90,
  student_3 = 75,
  student_4 = 86,
  student_5 = 62,
  student_6 = 79,
  student_7 = 96
))

data

```

$$Median = \frac {? + 1}{2} $$

::: notes

Have them work this out but if they forget to put in order, let them figure it out on their own but slightly lead them to it. 


:::


## Method Two Example

We have four college student's test scores on a particular exam:


```{r}

data <- data.frame(
  grades = c(
  student_1 = 85,
  student_2 = 90,
  student_3 = 75,
  student_4 = 86
))

data


```

$$(LM) = \frac {?}{2} $$
$$(UM) = \frac {?}{2} +1 $$
$$ Median = \frac {(? + ?)}{2}$$







## The Mode

[The most frequent number in a set of scores or column]{.grey}.

<br>

Simply sort your values in ascending order, then count and compare [(Hint: Look for numbers that repeat)]{.aqua}.

<br> 

![](Images/mode.png){fig-align="center"}

:::


## A Mode Example


We have seven college student's test scores on a particular exam:

<br>


```{r}

data <- data.frame(
  grades = c(
  student_1 = 85,
  student_2 = 90,
  student_3 = 75,
  student_4 = 85,
  student_5 = 62,
  student_6 = 79,
  student_7 = 96
))

data

```



$$ Mode = ?$$



## Normal Distribution

A set of scores that cluster in the center and tapers off to the left and right sides of the number line.

![](Images/normal.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
The shape of the right and left sides will look identical most of the time.
:::

## Outliers


[Extreme values that pull the distribution which leads to a [positive]{.green} or [negative]{.red} skew.]{.aqua}

<br>


![](Images/outlier.png){fig-align="center"}


::: footer

image: Medium

::: 

## Positive Skew

A clustering of scores in a distribution with some large scores pulled (or [skewed]{.green}) toward the [positive]{.green} side of the x-axis

![](Images/posskew.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

This occurs because of large scores (or outliers) along x-axis.

For example, the 150 - 200 number of sunspots.

:::

## Negative Skew

A clustering of scores in a distribution with some small scores that pulled (or [skewed]{.red})the towards the [negative]{.red} side of the x-axis.

![](Images/negskew.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This occurs because of small scores (or outliers) along x-axis.

For example, the lower scores (e.g., 30) on the zoology test score.

Imagine on the other side (the left) of the 0 on the x-axis there are negative numbers.

## Mnemonic Devices

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
These are [memory techniques]{.aqua} that aid in memory retention and retrieval.

<br>

Dates back to the early Greeks.

<br>

Helps transition short term to long term memory more quickly.

## Skew Mnemonic

When you hear the word ["skew"]{.blue} think of laying on a beach and putting your feet together while looking at the horizon.

<br>

Your r[i]{.green}ght foot is the pos[i]{.green}tive skew.

<br>

Your l[e]{.red}ft foot in the n[e]{.red}gative skew.

## Recap



* Measure of central tendency

<br> 

* Outliers

<br> 

* Distributions and Skews


## The Mean and Median to Determine Distribution Shape 

[Right skew]{.green} occurs when our Mean > Median.

<br>

[Left skew]{.red} occurs when our Mean < Median.

::: notes

Right skew occurs when tail of the distribution extends towards **higher** values, pulling the mean in that direction. 

Left skew occurs when the tail of the distribution extends towards **lower** values, dragging the mean down. 

When these are equal (or near equal), a normal distribution occurs.

## Deviation Score


The [deviation score]{.grey} is the distance between the mean of a variable and any given raw score in that variable. 

<br> 


$$d_i = x_i - \bar{x}$$

<br>

$d_i$ = deviation score 

$x_i$ = a given raw score (i.e., data point)  

$\bar{x}$ = the mean  

::: notes 

Focus on  the raw score here, make sure they understand it. Use the board



:::

## Deviation Score

This tells us two important things: 

1.) How far the raw score is from the mean ($\bar{x}$)

2.) Whether the raw score is greater or less than the mean ($\bar{x}$)

<br>

[Positive]{.green} deviation scores represent raw scores that greater than the mean.

<br>

[Negative]{.red} deviation scores represent raw scores that less than the mean.


## Deviation Score Example 

1.) Calculate the ($\bar{x}$)

<br>

2.) Calculate the $d_i = x_i - \bar{x}$ for each student 


```{r}

data <- data.frame(
  grades = c(
  student_1 = 85,
  student_2 = 90,
  student_3 = 75,
  student_4 = 85,
  student_5 = 62,
  student_6 = 79,
  student_7 = 96
))

data

```



::: notes 

$\bar{x}$ = 81.71
 
$d_i$ = 3.28, 8.28, -6.71, 3.28, -19.71, -2.71, 14.28  

Reiterate this again: 

[Positive]{.green} deviation scores represent raw scores that greater than the mean.

[Negative]{.red} deviation scores represent raw scores that less than the mean.
