# Teaching

This repo contains course material for the classes I have taught. It also provides access to my R tutorials. 

To recreate a syllabus document as a PDF you need to have TinyTex installed and loaded. 

``` r
install.packages("tinytex")  
library(tinytex)
```

If you have trouble with the {tinytex} install or the rendering of the PDFs (which is common) [this](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) provides a solid walkthrough. If you continue to have problems drop a new issue on the {tinytex} github [page](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/issues)

Additionally, my lectures and tutorials are created using Quarto in RStudio. For a tutorial on Quarto go <a href = "https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html" >here</a>.
