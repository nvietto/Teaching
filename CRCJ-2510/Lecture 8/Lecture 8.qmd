::: notes

**Survey Research** involves the collection of information from a sample of individuals through their response to questions. 

Useful because they are: 

**Versatile** - Researchers can ask respondents questions about almost any topic you can imagine. 

**Efficiency** - Can be collected from a great deal of people at a low cost and quickly. For example, [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/free-account/)

**Generalization** - When cross-population generalization is the goal, it is hard to top the survey design

## What is a Survey? 

::: columns

::: {.column}

[**Omnibus Survey**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* The General Social Survey ([GSS](https://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS)) is a form form of omnibus survey. 

* Started in 1972

* Occurs every two years

* Includes ~500 Questions (90-minute Interview)

* Limitations: questions lack depth

::: notes 

Typical surveys are directed at a specific research question. Although **Omnibus Surveys** covers a range of topics of interest to different social scientist. Most often it has multiple sponsors and is designed to generate data useful to a broad segment of the social science community.

::: notes

Maintain focus - should be guided by a well-defined inquiry and a definitively large population 

Build on existing lit - dont reinvent the wheel 

Consider translation - know your target population, if you need to have a translated version, make sure you have one

## Writing Questions 
### Construct Clear and Meaningful Questions

<br> 

[*Avoid confusing phrasing and vagueness*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}




::: {.panel-tabset}

### Confusing

How often do you carry methods of self-protection on you, while in the subway, after dark, with friends? 

### Clear and Meaningful

In the last month, how many days did you carry a method of self-protection such as pepper spray? 

:::


::: notes 

Clearly and simply phase questions are most likely to have the same meaning for different respondents 

Avoid wordy and longer questions 

Be brief and stick to the point 

Have a reference period

[*Avoid negatives and double negatives*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}




::: {.panel-tabset}

### Double Negatives 

Do you [disagree]{.fragment .highlight-red} that juveniles [should not]{.fragment .highlight-red} be tried as adults if they commit murder? 

### Clear and Meaningful

To what extent do you [agree or disagree]{.fragment .highlight-blue} with the following statement: Juveniles should be tried as adults if they commit murder.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Double barreled

[I believe we should stop spending so much money on prisons]{.fragment .highlight-red} and [put it into building more schools]{.fragment .highlight-red}. 


### Clear and Meaningful

I believe we should stop spending so much money on prisons. Yes ___  No ___

<br>

I believe we should invest more in education. Yes ___ No ___

[*Beware of "agreement bias"*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}




::: {.panel-tabset}

### Agreement bias

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: *The new health care plan is [worthy of support]{.fragment .highlight-red}.*

<br>

Have you ever [*shoplifted*]{.fragment .highlight-red} something from a store?


### Clear and Meaningful

To what extent do you [*support or oppose*]{.fragment .highlight-blue} the new health care plan?

<br> 

Have you ever [*taken anything from a store without paying for it?*]{.fragment .highlight-blue}


:::


::: notes 


People often tend to agree with a statement just to avoid seeming disagreeable.

Try to remain impartial 

Don't state the item in an illegal frame, word it differently

[*Likert-type responses*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}



**Select one choice below** 

I think "three strikes" laws that increase penalities for individuals convicted of three or more felonies will help to decrease the crime-rate. 


Strongly Agree ___  
Agree ___  
Neither Agree or Disagree ___   
Disagree ___  
Strongly Disagree ___

### Additional Guidelines for Fixed-Response Questions

<br>

[*Avoid Fence-Sitting*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

<br>

[*Floaters*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}






::: notes 

**Fence sitters** are people who see themselves as neutral in their attitudes toward a particular issue. 

This is a tricky maneuver in survey design because you want to be exhaustive but at the same time you want people to make a decision on a particular issue.   


**Floaters** are respondents who choose a substantive answer even when they do not know anything about a particular question. 

Ex. Research has shown that 1/3 of the public will provide an opinion on a proposed law they know nothing about if they are not provided with a "don't know" response option. 

Although providing the "don't know" option can provide an escape route for survey takers who just want to get the survey over and done with (i.e., every survey taker)

**Filter questions** help ensure that questions are asked only of relevant respondents. They allow for the creation of **skip patterns**.

::: notes 

Single questions are prone to **idiosyncratic variation** - which occurs when individuals responses vary because of their reactions to a particular word or ideas in a question. 

We all intrepret words differently due to our memories, educational background, and cultures

Therefore its best to use multple questions to measurre one variable (i.e., an **index or scale**)

Head to the board and operationalize a variable then create 5 Qs to describe it. Allow class to dicate it. 

When creating an index be sure to include both favorable and unfavorable items and **reverse code** on occasion

## Writing Questions
### Additional Guidelines for Fixed-Response Questions

<br>

[*Demographic Questions*]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* These include questions about information regarding gender, age, race/ethnicity, income, and religon. 

* Where should you put these within your survey? ([Beginning]{style="color:#007BB8;"} or [End]{style="color:#007BB8;"})

* Consider ordinal measures when concerned about protecting anonymity


## Writing Questions

[**Don't forget to pretest!**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Take the survey yourself or have a friend try it out
* Do as many drafts as possible



## Survey Designs 

[**Self Administered Surveys**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Conducted by mailing a questionnaire to respondents,  who administer the survey themselves. 

* Free to answer at leisure 

* Very cheap to administer 


::: notes 

Drawback: it is difficult to to maximize response rate 
- hard to incentivize. Most common is offering to be entered into a raffle or something similar
- Incomplete responses are a problem


:::


## Survey Designs 

[**Group-Administered Survey**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Completed by individual respondents assembled in a group. 

* Response rate is less of a problem 

* More expensive to create 


::: notes 

Drawback: 

- these are difficult to create and organize 

- Respondents can feel coerced to participate and thus less likely to be honest in response 


:::


## Survey Designs 

[**Surveys by Telephone**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Interviewers question respondents over the phone and then record their answers

* Most common method 

* Cheap to use 


::: notes 

Drawback: 

Reaching Sampling Units - Not reaching the proper sampling units 
  - Can use random digit dialer to somewhat help this 

Maximizing Response to Phone Surveys - Not getting enough complete response to make the results generalizable 


::: 


## Survey Designs 

[**In-Person Interviews**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* A face to face social interaction between interviewer and respondent. 

* Considered the best survey design 

* Expensive 


::: notes 

Drawbacks: time-consuming and costly 

Although, has higher response rates and researchers can go into great depth with their questions 

Can also use **Computer-assisted self interviewing (CASI)** which is just audio (multi languages), headphones, cpu and the respondents interact. 

::: 


## Survey Designs 

[**Web-Based Surveys**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Things like Qualtrics 

* Cheap and efficient 

* Can administer surveys all across the world. 

* Obtain high generalization 


::: notes 

The book suggests these aren't very good because everyone doesn't have a computer but I think that is a dated reference. 

::: 



## Survey Designs 

[**Mixed-Mode Surveys**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Combining methods

* Allows strength of one survey design to compensate for the weakness of another

* Maximizes the likelihood of securing data from different types of respondents 



::: notes 


On page 163 (Exhibit 7.7) there is a good breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of each method. 


::: 


## Ethical Issues in Survey Research

[**Protection of Respondents**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

<br>

[**Confidentiality**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}
