## Mixed Methods

What is **mixed methods** research? 


* It is research the utilizes [**both**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"} qualitative and quantitative methods in one project. 

* Utilizes both [*deductive and inductive*]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"} reasoning to answer a research question

::: notes

**Deductive reasoning** - testing ideas against observations 

**Inductive reasoning** - developing ideas from the observation

## Mixed Methods

It's basically just this!

<br>

## Mixed Methods

Why would you use both in a design? 

<br>

* To take advantage of each **strength** from each methodological approach when engaged in *different stages* of the research process

* Can add unique insights about the intervention process aka [**triangulation**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}



::: notes 

**Triangulation**

* use of multiple methods to study one research question 
* derived from land surveying, where locating a single landmark can help you locate yourself relative to the direction of the landmark
* a researcher can get a clearer picture of the social reality being studied by viewing it from two different perspectives.

## Mixed Methods
### Should Methods be Mixed?

<br>

* It depends.

* Methodological pluralists believe the social world is [**composed of multiple realities**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"} that cannot be understood without [multiple methods]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}. 

* In other words, both subjective reality composed of *individual experiences* (e.g., languages, cultures) **and** *objective reality* composed of material things and physical processes.



::: notes

Qualitative methods could be may be best suited to investifate subjective reality, while quanitative methods may be most appropriate for investigating objective realtity, an investigation of intersubjective reality may require both methods.

## Mixed Methods
### The Six Types of Methods

<br>

* [**Convergent Parallel Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}
* [**Exploratory Sequential Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}
* [**Embedded Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}
* [**Transformative Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}
* [**Multiphase Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}
* [**Explanatory Sequential Design**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}




## Mixed Methods
### Convergent Parallel Design

<br>

![](Images3/cvp.png){fig-align="center" height=400}


::: notes


The quantitative and qualitative methods are implemented at the same time the finds are integrated and interpreted together

Where does the triangulation occur in this design? 

Have the class decided on a topic and walk through a design on the board.

## Mixed Methods
### Explanatory Sequential Design 

<br>


![](Images3/expsd.png){fig-align="center" height=400}


::: notes



The qualitative method is implementd first followed by the quantitative methods


**Bachman (1992)** 
* Studies social causes of homicide within contemporary American Indian communities. 
* Bachman did a qual study first, because it was understudied and no one really new the cause
* So they conducted intensive face to face interviews of homicide offenders within three midwest state prison
* Ultimately led her to locate four casues: 
  1.) social disorganization 
  2.) culture of honor 
  3.) economic deprivation 
  4.) culture conflict
* these contributed to alcohol/drug use which she hypothesized led to homicide
* Upon quantititative analysis, she found support for social disorganization and economic deprivation.

## Mixed Methods 
### Exploratory Sequential Design 

<br>


![](Images3/plan.png){fig-align="center" height=400}


::: notes

The qualitative method is implementd first followed by the quantitative methods

Example:

1.) You first interview motorist to develop an initial understanding of problem areas, and draw preliminary conclusions. 

2.) Then you analyze accident statistics to test whether cyclist perceptions line up with where accidents occur.

## Mixed Methods
### Embedded Design 

<br>


![](Images3/embed.png){fig-align="center" height=400}

::: notes 

Occurs when the primary method is qualitative or quantitative but the researcher adds the other omponent to gain another additional insight

Where does triangulation occur here?

:::

## Mixed Methods
### Transformative Design 

<br>


![](Images3/transform.png){fig-align="center" height=400}


::: notes

Creates new social justice–oriented research by employing qualitative and quantitative methods within a single phase, sequential phases, or concurrently

:::


## Mixed Methods
### Multiphase Design

<br>


![](Images3/multi.png){fig-align="center" height=400}

::: notes 

Involves a series of quant and qual designs, each design informs the next, then leads to a final mixed methods using both.

## Comparing Results Across Studies
### Meta-Analysis

A **quantitative** method for identifying patterns in findings across multiple studies of the same research question. 


For example, **Pratt and Cullen's** [[**THE EMPIRICAL STATUS OF GOTTFREDSON AND HIRSCHI'S GENERAL THEORY OF CRIME: A META-ANALYSIS**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00911.x)


**Effect size** is the key statistic to capture the association between the IV and DV across multiple studies. 

::: notes

Overall, the sample  includes 21 empirical  studies, which contained 126 effect size estimates, representing the integration of 49,727 individual cases.


**What is low self control?**

Uni dimensional trait consisting of impulsivity, simple > complex tasks, risk seeking, physical > cerebral activities, self-centered orientation, volatile temperament

* Established in early childhood when parents fail to monitor the child's behavior. In other words, do not correct (punish) deviant behavior when present
* After age 8-10, the trait becomes stable throughout the lifetime
* Parenting should have no effect on delinquency after this point
•	SC should fully mediate the effect
* In combination with the uni dimensional trait, an opportunity to commit crime needs to be present (interaction effect)
* Immediate > delayed pleasures, mentally and physically easy, not requiring physical or mental exertion, little risk of detection or resistance

Gott-fredson  and Hirschi’s core  proposition that low self-control  increases involvement in criminal and analogous behaviors is  empirically supported


**Effect size** is a standardized measure of association - often the difference b.w the mean of the exp group and the mean of the control group on the dv, adjusted for the variability in the two groups

Be careful with meta analysis interpretations. They are only as good as the studies you put into them. **Garbage in, garbage out**

:::



## Comparing Results Across Studies
### Meta-Synthesis

A **qualitative** method used to analyze and integrate findings from multiple qualitative studies. 

For example, **Moeller et al., (2016)** [[**Advancing restictive deterrence: a qualitative meta-synthesis**]{style="color:#E9FFFC;"}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235216300216)




::: notes

Restrictive deterrence refers to the strategies offenders use to reduce their risk in response to sanctions.  

It occurs when offenders reduce the frequency, severity, or duration of their offending, or displace their crimes temporally, spatially, or tactically. 

Conduct a qualitative meta-synthesis (QMS) on research on restrictive deterrence with the aims of integrating, comparing, and translating findings across 17 studies. The studies examine restrictive deterrence in drug dealing, prostitution and auto-theft. 

Offenders use strategies for avoidance and management of arrest risk and mitigation of punishment in response to sanction threats. 

Reductions in offending from deterrent efforts, including the frequency, duration and severity of crime is crime-contingent and partially offset by offenders becoming more embedded in criminal networks and emboldened as they perceive their adaptations as effective.
