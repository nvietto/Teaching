# Hypothesis Testing - Two Categorical Variables

## Parametric Statistics 

These are statistics that are used when the sampling distribution is [normal distributed]{.orange}.

## Non-Parametric Statistics 

These are statistics that are used when the sampling distribution is [not normal distributed]{.orange}.

## Statistical Significance

::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

This is a claim that a set of observations are [not due to random chance]{.blue}.

<br>

Used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to [reject the null hypothesis]{.blue}.

<br>

Leads to a lot of problems within research when relied on.

::: notes

We will discuss this in greater depth in the upcoming chapters - specifically how we measure it and the problems that come about when research relies on it. 

Recall if the null true, it suggests that **any changes are because of random chance** and not because of a relationship between variables. 

If this is false, it suggests that we can **reject the $H_0$** and [accept our alternative hypothesis]{.blue}.

It's important to understand, that we are only reject the $H_0$ , and **not confirming anything**, other than the relationship expressed in the null is **not occurring within our sample.**

## Chi Square 

This is used when the [IV and DV are both categorical]{.blue} and the data is not normally distributed [(i.e., non-parametric)]{.orange}.

<br>

$$x^2 = \frac{\sum (O - E)^2}{E}$$

<br>

O = Observed frequency

E = Expected frequency 

$$E = \frac{(row  \, total)(column  \, total)}{(sample  \, size)} $$


::: notes

Recall categorical variables are either Nominal or Ordinal (ranked).

## Chi-Square Example 

Is gender and education level dependent at a 5% level of significance?

In other words, in the data below, is there a relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?

<br>

|  | High School | Bachelors | Masters | Total
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Female    | 60   |  54 |   46   | 160
| Male     | 40  |   44 |  53   | 137
| Total    | 100  | 98 |   99  | 297



## Chi-Square Example 

Let's first state our null and alternative hypothesis: 

<br>

$H_0$ Gender and education level are independent, there is [no relationship]{.blue} between gender and education level.

<br>

$H_A$ Gender and education level are dependent, there is [a relationship]{.blue} between gender and education level.


## Chi-Square Example 


$$E = \frac{(row  \, total)(column  \, total)}{(sample  \, size)}$$

<br>


|  | High School | Bachelors | Masters | Total
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Female    | $\frac{(160)(100)}{297}$|$\frac{(160)(98)}{297}$|$\frac{(160)(99)}{297}$| 160
| Male     | $\frac{(137)(100)}{297}$|$\frac{(137)(98)}{297}$|$\frac{(137)(99)}{297}$| 137
| Total    | 100  | 98 |   99  | 297




## Chi-Square Example 



|  | High School | Bachelors | Masters | 
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Female    | 60   |  54 |   46   |
| Male     | 40  |   44 |  53   |
: Observed



|  | High School | Bachelors | Masters |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:
| Female    | 53.87   |  52.68 | 53.45  
| Male     | 46.13  |   44.32 |  46.55   
: Expected




::: notes 


$$x^2 = \frac{\sum (O - E)^2}{E}$$

::: 

## Chi-Square Example{.scrollable}

$$\chi^2 =  \left( \frac{(60 - 53.87)^2}{53.87} \right) +  \left( \frac{(54 - 52.68)^2}{52.68} \right) +  \left( \frac{(46 - 53.45)^2}{53.45} \right) +  \left( \frac{(40 - 46.13)^2}{46.13} \right) +  \left( \frac{(44 - 44.32)^2}{44.32} \right) +  \left( \frac{(53 - 46.55)^2}{46.55} \right)$$

<br>

$$\chi^2 \approx 3.45 $$

## Degrees of Freedom 

The [degrees of freedom for the chi-square]{.orange} are calculated using the following formula:

<br>

$$df = (r-1)(c-1)$$ 


r = row number 

c = column number 


::: notes 

Mention how this differs in how we calculated df in the previous module 

::: 


## Chi-Square Example

Now, we need to compare this value to the critical value from the chi-square distribution at a [5% significance level]{.orange}. 

<br>

 $$(2−1)×(3−1) = 2$$ 
 
[2 degrees of freedom]{.orange}

<br>

If the observed chi-square test statistic is [greater than the critical value]{.blue}, the null hypothesis can be rejected.

If the observed chi-square test statistic is [less than the critical value]{.red}, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.



## Chi-Square Example

Now lets take our [df value of 12]{.orange} and find our [critical value]{.blue} with our [5% (0.05) significance level]{.orange} and locate the critical value in a chi-square distribution chart (p. 375). 

The critical value is 5.99

![](images3/chi.png){fig-align="center"}



## Chi-Square Example

$\chi^2$ = 3.45 

<br>

The critical value =  5.99

<br>

$3.483 < 5.99$, [we fail reject the null hypothesis]{.blue}.

<br>

Therefore, at a 5% significance level, [we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a relationship between gender and education level]{.orange}.
