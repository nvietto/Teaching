[Research Abstract](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/minneapolis-domestic-violence-experiment)


::: notes

Purpose: The study aimed to assess the impact of three different police responses to domestic violence calls:
  (Randomily Assigned)
a. Arrest: Officers would arrest the primary aggressor in the domestic dispute.  
b. Separation: Officers would separate the involved parties without making an arrest.  
c. Mediation: Officers would attempt to mediate and resolve the dispute without making an arrest  

The arrest strategy had the most significant impact in preventing subsequent acts of domestic violence.

## The Process and Problems of Criminological Research
### **Criminological Research Questions**

- This is a question about some aspect of crime or deviance that the researcher seeks to answer through the **collection** and **analysis** of firsthand, verifiable, empirical data.

## The Process and Problems of Criminological Research
### **Refine the question**

- Read

- Develop a list

- Read

- Narrow your list 

- Read

- Repeat

::: notes

The key to developing a research question is reading. Look to extend a study, it's not so much about finding a genius idea, as it is more just improving previous studies. 

:::

## The Process and Problems of Criminological Research
### **Evaluating the Question**

- Feasibility  

- Social Importance

- Scientific Relevance

::: notes 

Feasibility 
  - time constraints 
  - resorces
  - does the data exist, or do you have to collect it

Social Importance
  - Could answering this question make a difference for society
  - Do you find it interesting
  - Does this affect policy 

Scientific Relevance  
  - Every reesearch question should be grounded in existing empirical literature
  - Doing this prevents making misktakes that have already been made
  - Reinventing the wheel 

:::

## The Role of Criminological Theory
### **What is a Theory?**

- It's a logical interrelated set of propositions about empirical reality.

- What are the elements of a theory?

a.) Constructs 
  - describe what is important to examine in order to understand, explain, predict, and "do something" about crime.

b.) Falsifiable 
  - If we can't empirically scrutinize a theory, it's not a theory at all, but a philosophy or faith-based belief.

## The Role of Criminological Theory
### **Deterrence Theory**

*Cesare Beccaria*

People are at least marginally rational; they weigh the expected costs and benefits of their actions.

:::
:::

::: notes

- Criminal sanctions can deter crime generally and specifically
  - Swift, Certain, and Severe

General (observing the punishment) and Specific (the actual punishment, individual) deterrence

::: 


## The Role of Criminological Theory
### **Labeling Theory**

*Frank Tannenbaum*

Distinguishes between **primary** (the act of individuals that lead to public sanction) and **secondary** (the deviance that occurs in response to the public sanction) deviance.


```{r}

(image: Columbia Magazine)
:::
:::

::: notes 

Sanctions label individuals as "deviant" in the eyes of others

Once the label is applied, others will treat the person as a deviant, causing the person to act in a way consistent with the label.

Punishing a person stimulates more of the behavior it was meant to eliminate

## Recap

- How do we answer criminological research questions? 

- What are the elements of a theory? 

- What theories did we discuss?

::: notes

Through the **collection** and **analysis** of firsthand, verifiable, empirical data. 

a.) Constructs 
  - describe what is important to examine in order to understand, explain, predict an event. 

b.) Falsifiable 
  - If we can't empirically scrutinize a theory, it's not a theory at all, but a philosophy or faith-based belief.

::: notes 

Head to the board!

From our theory, we form testable hypotheses about the relationship between two or more *variables*.

Deductive reasoning begins with a general idea or theory and proceeds to collect specific information (data).
    - Your theory is that the moon revolves around the earth
    - How would me collect data to test that theory?
      - Moon phases 

Inductive reasoning is just the opposite: here, you have specific data, and you try to develop theory based on those data.
    - You notice the moon looks differently on different nights of the week 
    - How would data inform this to create theory? 
      - The moon appears at be different every night, therefore the moon must be reflecting its light differently. Since earth revolves around the sun, the moon must be revoling around the earth. 

All research is an effort to connect theory and empirical data, and the two have a mutually reinforcing relationship.

## Social Research Strategies 
### **Variables** 

A [**var**]{style="color:#26408B;"}iable is a characteristic or property that can [**vary**]{style="color:#26408B;"} (e.g., eye color, age, height, general happiness, etc.).

**Two Types**

- [**In**dependent Variable]{style="color:#008000;"}  
  - The characteristic that [**In**]{style="color:#008000;"}fluences

- [Dependent Variable]{style="color:#800080;"}     
  - The [**outcome**]{style="color:#800080;"} that changes 

::: notes 

Head to the board!

Make sure this is clear!!!! 

Give ezamples and ask what variable is what!
  Age's effect on height? (IV and DV)

Briefly mention a constant variable, if they understand the other two well 

:::

## Case Study
### **UNO's Hypothetical Domestic Violence Experiment**

- Imagine you're a police officer and you've been dispatched to a domestic violence call.
- What options do you have to resolve the matter?
    - Arrest
    - Seperate them
    - Mediation or Counsel
- Which do you think would most effectively reduce **repeat offenses**?


::: notes

Ask what varaible is what? (IV or DV)

How do we test this?

## Case Study
### **Phase 1: Deductive Reasoning**

:::
:::

::: notes

Based on these results, many jurisdictions implemented mandatory arrest policies.

When there is probable cause that a domestic assault occurred, the offender must be arrested.

Do you think this is a smart policy? Why or why not?

:::


## Case Study
### **Phase 2: Deductive Reasoning**

- We need to **replicate**!

::: notes

Measurement validity, generalizability, and causal validity. (Ask them what those are)

Remember, we should always be concerned about validity:
  - There are concerns about this study;
    - Most domestic assaults actually don't get reported to police
    - Did the officers follow the randomization protocol
    - Are these result (arrest work the best) GENERALIZABLE? 
 - So we must replicate 
 
Findings: 

The researchers tightened up the randomization process so that police officers would be more likely to adhere

In Colorado Springs and Dade County, results were similar to Minneapolis: arrest seemed to lower recidivism

But in Omaha, Charlotte, and Milwaukee, researchers found long-term increases in DV among those who were arrested.

## Case Study
### **Phase 3: Inductive Reasoning**

What do you think might explain why the replication studies were so inconsistent?

:::

::: notes

Reasons? 
- Function of different samples?
- Implementation? (How it was randomized)
- Is the theory wrong?

Sherman turns to control theory (Jackson Toby, 1957):

- Stakes in conformity decrease a person's propensity to offend.
    - Hypothesis derived from theory: people who are employed, married, have kids are more likely to be deterred by the threat of arrest than those who are unemployed, single, and have no kids.
    - Because they have more to lose

Re-examination of Milwaukee data: offenders who were married/employed were less likely to recividate. 

:::

## How may times have we been around the research wheel? What did we find out? 

- Minneapolis study **seemed** to support deterrence theory (i.e., arrests works)

- Only **2/5** SARP sites **replicated** the Minneapolis findings; thus, arrest doesn't always deter DV recidivism.
  - So maybe deterrence theory doesn't work? 
  
- Re-examine Milwaukee w/control theory in mind: arrest is a deterrence if a person is **married**
  - Which means we are leaning toward.....

## Case Study
### **Phase 4: Deductive Reasoning Again**

**Ray Paternoster** and colleagues (1997) reexaminned the Milwaukee data to test procedural justice theory.

:::
:::

::: notes 

WHy?
  - Milwaukee's arrest condition had a **criminological effect**, in other words, arrests increased the of future offending
  - So Paternoster suggested perhaps it was HOW they were treated during the arrest that explained it - PJ theory

Explain:

Procedural Justice Theory -
  - people will comply with the law out of a sense of duty annd obligation if they are treated farily by legal authorities

Results:

Recidivism levels among the High PJ arrestee group were comparable to the warned group. This supports PJ theory - how people are treated may matter more to them than the outcome they receive.

## **Guidelines for Criminologist**
1.) Test ideas against empirical reality without becoming too invested in an outcome.   
2.) Plan and carry out investigations systematically.  
3.) Document all procedures and disclose them publicity.  
4.) Clarify assumptions.   
5.) Define your terms.   
6.) Maintain a skeptical stance.  
7.) Replicate research and accumulate knowledge.  
8.) Maintain interest in theory.  
9.) Search regularities or patterns.  


::: notes

1.) Empirical testing requires a neutral open minded approach. You cannot be personally interested (e.g., financial gains) in the outcome. Let the data guide you. 
2.) It can get messy. For example, the randomization process can get thrown off. 
3.) Transparency is crucial for the scientific method. Like in the study we discussed, the results need to be replicated repeatedly. Without transparency, we hinder science. 
4.) Assumptions are present in all studies. Disclose the assumptions you make. 
  - Election polls assume that people actually vote for the candidate they say they'll vote for. 
5.) Words can have unclear meanings, or be poorly defined. So be sure to define them and be consistent
6.) The results of any particular study must be examined critically.
7.) No one study can settle a matter; there will always be some plausible threats to its validity.
      - On this point, it is also important to note that research results should be published so that we don't fall victim to publication bias.
8.) Theory should always be involved. 
9.) Anecdotes and outliers do not negate a theory.
