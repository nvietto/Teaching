## What do we mean by qualitative methods?

::: notes 

**Why and when to use:**

* Exploratory research questions (lack of theory)

* Focus on unstudied (or understudied) processes and phenomena

* Orientation to social context and the interconnections between processes

* Focus on human subjectivity

* Focus on events experienced leading up to outcome

* Reflexive research design that evolves as the project progresses

* Sensitivity to researcher subjectivity

## Participant Observation

<br>

Gathering data while developing a sustained relationship with individual or group while they go about their normal activities.

**Three Types**

* [Complete Observation]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* [Participation and Observation]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* [Covert Participation]{style="color:#007BB8;"}




::: notes 

**Complete Observation**

* Researchers try to see things as they happen, without disrupting the participants

* Although since the participants can see the observer there is a **reactive effect**, in which the participants do what they are doing while they know they are being observed, as opposed to doing the task without observation.


**Participation and Observation**

* Participate with group being studied, but make clear that you are also studying them

* Observes and interacts, but does not participate in group

* Inform some members of group about research

* Participate enough to develop rapport and gain sense of what group members experience, but people know that you are not 'one of them'


**Covert Participation**

* Researcher operates as fully functioning member of the group or social setting

* Most people being studied are usually not aware that they are being studied

* Reduces the chance of a **reactive effect**

* Cannot openly record or take notes

* Can influencce the outcome of the DV or event

## Ethnography

<br>

The study of culture or cultures that a group or people share 

<br>

*As a method*, it refers to the process of the participant observation by a single investigator who immerses themself into a group for an extended period of time.

::: notes 


* Major form of data collection is 'being there'


::: 

## Intensive Interviewing 

<br>

Utilizes open-ended and unstructured questioning posed to uncover in-depth information regarding the respondents feelings, experiences and perceptions

::: notes

* Aims to develop a comprehensive picture of intervieweeâ€™s background, attitudes and actions in their own words

* Gathering new particiapant untill the **saturation** point emerges. This is when new interviews yield little additional information

* Recording responses must be accurate but unobtrusive


:::



## Focus Groups 

<br>

Utilizes unstructured group interviews in which the group leader actively encourages group discussion among participants

::: notes 

* Samples include recruited participants that represent target population

* Ask specific questions & guide discussions

* Encourage all members to participate

* Information gathered is qualitative and unstructured

:::


## Sampling 

<br>

[**Theoretical sampling**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

<br> 

[**Experience Sampling Method (ESM)**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}


::: notes 


**Theoretical sampling**

* Does not occur at beginning

* Researcher learns of important processes during data collection and makes certain to sample enough people to investigate fully

**Experience Sampling Method (ESM)**

* Subjects carry pagers and when paged, they fill out reports of what they are doing at the time


::: 

## Note Taking

<br>

Primary method of recording participant observation data.

::: notes 

* A lot like journalism. 

* Usually a mistake to try to take comprehensive notes while engaged in the field because it is too disruptive

* Field researchers typically jot down partial notes while observing

* After leaving field, researchers retreat to their computer, hand-write or dictate more complete notes on a daily basis 

::: 


## Writing Up Field Notes 

<br>

These must be complete, detailed, and true. 

<br>

::: notes 


* With the aid of the jottings things done or short hand notes, researchers usually remember a great deal of what happened

* Write comprehensive field notes immediately afterward, or at least within the next 24 hours

* Write field notes before they have been discussed with anyone else

* Writing notes usually requires a significant amount of time so schedualing is critical

## Systamtic Observation 

<br>


Sampson & Raudenbush (1999) - ["Systematic social observation of public spaces"](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/210356)

<br>

Researchers drove around slowly through neighborhoods and recorded the types of disorder in the neighborhoods. 

1.) [**Physical disorder**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

2.) [**Social disorder**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

::: notes 


* We discussed this last module 

* PD = cigarettes on ground, graffiti, abandoned cars 

* SD = adults loitering, intoxicated people, drug sales

::: 

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Data Analyssis

<br>

::: columns

::: {.column}

[**Qualitative Data Analysis**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Focus on abstract understudied social phenomena (Exploratory)

* Rich data from few cases

* No pre-determined categories or directions

:::


::: {.column}

[**Quantitative Data Analysis**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Focus on quantifying social phenomena

* Relies on collect *a lot* of data

* Analyses, categories of data planned in advance

:::

:::



## Qualitative vs Quantitative Data Analyssis

<br>

::: columns

::: {.column}

[**Qualitative Data Analysis**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Conclusions reflect sensitivity to the social situation being studied

* Goal is rich descriptions of the social world

:::


::: {.column}

[**Quantitative Data Analysis**]{style="color:#007BB8;"}

* Conclusions aimed toward making generalizations

* Goal is valid & reliable measurement of specific variables


:::

## Grounded Theory

:::
::: 


::: notes 

* Creation of grounded theory is goal of much qualitative research

* Which means, inductively build up a systematic theory that is 'grounded' in, or based on, the observations.

* The observations are summarized into conceptual categories, which are tested directly in the research setting with more observations.
