## Probability

[A number that represents the likelihood an event will occur.]{.blue}

A theoretical prediction is a prediction, grounded in logic, about whether or not a certain event will occur.


A empirical outcome (i.e., observed outcome) is a numerical result from a sample, such as a mean or a frequency.

## Probabiltity vs Proportion Coin Example

::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

If we flip a fair coin, the [probability]{.blue} that it lands on heads is 1/2 or 50%. 

<br> 

But if we flip a coin 20 times and count the number of times it lands on heads, lets say 12 times, then our [proportion]{.blue} is 12/20 or 60%.

## Coin Example


Let's flip some coins!

<br>

```{webr-r}

coin_flip <- function(i = NULL) {
      flip <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5) # (# of random numbers, # of trials, probability)
      flip <- ifelse(flip == 1, "Tails", "Heads")
      return(flip)
  }

coin_flip()

```




::: notes

Work through this. Probability verse proportion. 

Flip multiple trials. Then do two coins at once

## Card Example 

![](Images2/card.png){fig-align="center"}



::: notes

Work through this. Probability verse proportion. 

**There are 52 cards in the deck, with 4 suits and two colors**

What is the probability that I pull a red card? 

**26/52**

What is the probabilty that I pull a diamond card? 

**13/52 or 1/4**

What is the probability that I pull a 10 card? 

**4/52 or 1/13 or 7%**

When you predict that a card will be the 9 of spades, what is the probability that the card you pull will be anything except the 9 of spades?
 
 $\frac{52 - 1} {52}$

When you predict that a card will be the jack of diamonds, what is the probability that you will actually pull the ace of hearts instead?

**Each card in the deck has an equal chance of being drawn, so the probability of drawing any specific card is 1/52.**

Then do a proportion with the actual cards, playing high or low.

# Discrete Probability


## Discrete Probability

A type of probability that deals with the likelihood an event will occur within a [finite (limited) possible outcomes]{.blue}. 

[Binomials]{.blue} 

::: {.nonincremental}

Trials (i.e., an act with an different outcomes) that have [exactly]{.blue} two possible outcomes.

- Coin flips

- Chances of success for a free-throw shooter in basketball, where 1 = a basket made and 0 = a miss.

:::

[Binomial probability distribution]{.aqua} contains all the possible results over a set of trials and lists the probability of each result.







::: notes

Binomials are sometimes referred to as dichotomous or binary. 


To use a binomial probability distribution we need to calculate the binomial coefficient.


:::


## The Binomial Coefficient and the Probability Distribution 

[Criteria]{.blue}

<br>

1.) Fixed Trials

<br>

2.) Independent Trials 

<br>

3.) Fixed Probability of Success

<br>

4.) Two Mutuallly Exclusive Outcomes



## The Binomial Coefficient and the Probability Distribution 

$$ p(x) = \binom{n}{x}p^xq^{n-x}$$


p(x) = probability of x occurring

x = number of successes

n = sample size

p = probability event will occur

q = probability event will not occur


::: notes 

$\binom{n}{x}$ this simply mean "n choose x", in other words, how many different ways there are to pick x items from a set of ùëõ elements.



::: 


## Breakdown of "n choose x"

$$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$

<br>

n = sample size   
x = number of successes   
! = factorial 




## What is q? 


$$q = (p - 1)$$

<br>

p = probability event will occur  
q = probability event will [not]{.blue} occur

## Example 

Do people prefer Qdoba or Chipotle? Let's say asked three people what they prefer. 

![](images2/chip.png){.absolute bottom=100 right=100 width="300" height="300"}


![](images2/qdob.png){.absolute bottom=100 left=100 width="300" height="300"}


::: notes

If there is no difference between choice, then each Qdoba and Chipotle have a 50% chance of being selected.

0.5, 0.5, 0.5 on the board. 

So if we say the first 2 will go with Qdoba and the final will go to Chipotle the probability is: 

0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125

But we are conditioning on order as well. 


::: 

## Example


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

But we are conditioning on order here. 

<br>

0.5 * 0.5 * [0.5]{.blue} = 0.125

0.5 * [0.5]{.blue} * 0.5 = 0.125

[0.5]{.blue} * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125

<br>

0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = ?

::: 

::: notes

0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = .375

There is 0.375 probability that 2 out of 3 people would randomly prefer Qboda. 


::: 




## Let's work the formula 

Do people choose Qdoba or Chipotle? Let's say asked [3]{.blue} people what they prefer (with a probability (p) of 0.50 for choosing Qdoba) - [2]{.blue2} people chose Qdoba and [1]{.aqua} chose Chipotle. 

<br>

What is the probability that people preferred Qdoba? 

$$p(x) = (\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!})p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$
x = ?

n = ?

p = ?



## Let's attack our 'n choose x' first


$$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$

$$\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!}$$


$$\frac{6}{2}=3$$

::: notes

3 ways that 2 out of 3 people could prefer x instead of y

xxy, xyx, yxx

::: 

## Let's continue 

$$ p(x) = (3)p^xq^{n-x}$$

<br>

$p^x$ is the probability that Qdoba was chosen 2 out of 3 times.  





::: notes

It consolidates the 0.5 * 0.5 for x

:::

## Let's continue 


$$p(x) = (3)0.5^2(1-p)^{n-x}$$

<br>

1.) This is the probability that someone will prefer Chipolte

$$(1 - 0.50) = 0.50$$


<br>

2.) This corresponds to the one person that preferred Chipotle 

$$(3 - 2) = 1$$



## Final Version

Before simplified: 

$$p(x) = (\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!})0.5^2(1-0.5)^{3-2}$$

Simplified:

$$p(x) = (3)(0.25)(0.5)$$


$$p(x) = 0.375$$

::: notes 

PEMDAS means parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.


p(x) = 0.375

There is a 37% chance that two people would pick Qdoba.

## Recap

The Binomial Coefficient or 'n choose k' 

$$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$



The Binomial Probability Distribution 

$$p(x) = (\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!})p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$

Now that we covered the surface of binomial distributions, let's dig a little deeper, with [multiple binomial coefficient calculations]{.blue}. 


## Lets review exponent rules

## Example 2 

Let's imagine there are [4 Formula-1 races]{.blue} that will occur in June and July, Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing has a [60% chance of winning]{.blue}.

Assuming that the races are independent of each other, what is the probability that he will win [0 races, 1 race, 2 races, 3 races, or all 4 races]{.blue}?



$$p(x) = (\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!})p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$





# Let's break this down with 4 steps

## Step 1

[What do we know?]{.blue}

<br>

n = 4 races

<br>

x = He will win: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 races

<br>

p = 0.60

<br>


* Since x has multiple outcomes, we must calculate the binomial coefficient for each.



## Step 2


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Calculate 'n choose x' for each x]{.blue}

* 0 $\binom{4}{0} = \frac{4!}{0!(4-0)!} = 1$

* 1 $\binom{4}{1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = 4$

* 2 $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$

* 3 $\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4$

* 4 $\binom{4}{4} = \frac{4!}{4!(4-4)!} = 1$

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}


$$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$


:::

:::





::: notes 



Remember this just tells us how many different ways there are for 'n to choose x'.

So for 0, 1 makes sense because. All four races can only have the order of 0, 0, 0, 0. 

Same idea for 1 - 1,0,0,0 or 0,1,0,0 or 0,0,1,0 or 0,0,0,1. 


:::


## Step 3


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Plug in and solve the rest]{.blue}

* $(1)0.60^0(1-0.60)^{4-0} = 0.0256$

* $(4)0.60^1(1-0.60)^{4-1} = 0.1536$

* $(6)0.60^2(1-0.60)^{4-2} = 0.3456$

* $(4)0.60^3(1-0.60)^{4-3} = 0.3456$

* $(1)0.60^4(1-0.60)^{4-4} = 0.1296$

:::

$$(Step\,2)\,p^xq^{n-x}$$


:::

:::

::: notes 

Since 0 raised to any power except 0 equals 1, this term is equal to 1.

## Step 4 


::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Summarize the result]{.blue}

<br>

Max Verstappen has a ...

<br>

2.56% chance to win 0 races.



15.36% chance to win 1 races.



34.56% chance to win 2 races.


34.56% chance to win 3 races.



 12.96% chance to win 4 races.

# Continuous Probability: The Standard Normal Curve

## Standard Normal Curve

Sometimes our distribution can have a lot of variance and thus can result in varying levels of kurtosis.


To compensate for this, we can standardize our scores by apply a [z-score]{.blue}. 



![](images2/stand.png){fig-align="center"}


::: footer

image: Math is fun

::: 



## Z-Score

Tells you how many [standard deviations]{.blue} a specific point is away from the mean of a distribution.

<br>


[Positive z-score]{.green}: A positive z-score indicates that the value (x) lies [above the mean]{.green} by a certain number of standard deviations. 

<br>

[Negative z-score]{.red}: A negative z-score indicates that the value (x) lies [below the mean]{.red} by a certain number of standard deviations. 

<br>

[Zero z-score]{.grey}: A z-score of 0 means the value (x) is exactly [equal to the mean]{.grey} of the data set.

::: notes

(+) A z-score of +1.5 signifies that the value is 1.5 standard deviations higher than the mean.

(-) A z-score of -2.0 signifies that the value is 2 standard deviations lower than the mean.

:::


## Z-Score

$$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$$

 
$x$ = Raw score  
${\bar{x}}$ = Sample mean   
${\sigma}$ = Standard deviation  



## Z-Score Example 

Imagine you have a class of 20 students and you give them a math test. The mean was 75 points, and the standard deviation (SD) is (+/-) 10 points.

<br>

One student scored 88 points on the test. Calculate the z-score for the student.


$$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$$

## Z-Score Example 


$$z = \frac{88 - 75}{10}$$
$$z = 1.30 $$


The score is [1.30 standard deviations above the mean]{.blue}. 

<br>

In other words, the student preformed better than 1.30 standard deviations compared to the average score in the class.
