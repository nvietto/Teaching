# Hypothesis testing with two population means


## Let's break down the steps 

* State our null and alternative hypothesis 

* Identify the distribution and compute the degrees of freedom 

* Find the critical value using what we know in step 2  

* Compute student's t test or our ANOVA (we'll get here this week)

* Accept or reject our null hypothesis 


## One-tailed or two-tailed 

We use a one-tailed if our hypothesis involves [one direction]{.blue} {e.g.,., greater than, less than, bigger, smaller, etc.).

<br>

We use a two-tailed (most common) if we are looking into [differences between two group without predicting the direction]{.orange}.

# Newish Equations Incoming 🧮

## Pooled Standard Deviation 

[A measure of dispersion obtained by pooling multiple sample data sets (in our case two) into one large data set to calculate an grouped standard deviation.]{.blue}

<br>

$$\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{{(n_1 - 1) \cdot \sigma^2_1 + (n_2 - 1) \cdot \sigma^2_2}}{{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}}$$
$n$ = sample size 

$\sigma$ = standard deviation




## T-Statistic for Independent Samples

[We use this value to compare with our critical value in order to accept or reject our null.]{.blue} 

$$t = \frac{{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}}{{\sigma_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}}$$
$\bar{x}$ = Sample mean

$n$ = Sample size

$\sigma_p$ = pooled standard deviation




## Student's t Test 

A test that is used to compare the means of [two groups]{.orange}, where the independent variable is [categorical]{.blue} and our dependent variable is [continuous]{.orange}.

<br>

Helps determine if the differences between means are [reliably]{.blue} different or just due to chance. 

<br>

We use the t-distribution here and we calculate the degrees of freedom by: 

$$df = (n_1 + n_2) - 2$$

 
 
## Example 

Suppose we have two groups of students - [Group A]{.orange} and [Group B]{.violet}. We want to know if there is a significant difference (95% or 0.05) in their exam scores.




::: columns 

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Group A]{.orange}

n = 20

$\bar{x}$ = 75

$\sigma$ = 10

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Group B]{.violet}

n = 20

$\bar{x}$ = 80
 
$\sigma$ = 12

:::

::: 



#### [Null Hypothesis $H_0$]{.aqua}: There is no [meaningful]{.blue} difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B.

#### [Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$]{.aqua}: There is a [meaningful]{.blue} difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B.
 
 
  
## Example 

We use a t-distribution (p. 373) and we calculate the degrees of freedom to find our critical value. 

<br>

$(n + n)- 2$ 

<br>


$(20 + 20) - 2 = 38$

* Uh oh! There's no 38 on the table! When this occurs we just use the value closest to our df. So here, we use 40.
* 2.021

## Example 

::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### 1) Plug in our knowns

<br>

#### 2) Calulate the numerator with our Order of Operations in mind

<br>

#### 3) Calulate the denominator

<br>

#### 4) Divide

<br>

#### 5) Square root it

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

$$\sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{{(n_1 - 1) \cdot \sigma^2_1 + (n_2 - 1) \cdot \sigma^2_2}}{{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}}$$

## Example

-1.43

::: 

## Example 

Our critical value was $\pm$ 2.021. 

<br>

If the t-value is [greater than the critical t-value]{.blue}, we [reject the null hypothesis]{.green} and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

<br>


$|-1.43| < 2.021$ 

#### (you don't have to use an absolute value here but it helps with interpreting)

$1.43 < 2.021$
 
Therefore, *🥁 drum roll 🥁*...


## Example 
 
 
We fail to reject the null hypothesis!

<br>

There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a [meaningful]{.blue} difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B.
 
 
 

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

<br>

Used to examine a [meaningful]{.blue} relationship between the means of [more than two groups]{.orange}. 

<br>
 
The independent variable must be categorical (e.g., ) and the dependent variable [continuous]{.orange}.
 

 
 
## Different Types of Variance in ANOVA

::: columns

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Between-group]{.blue} variance 

::: {.nonincremental}

* Measures the extent each group is similar or different from other groups within the sample 

* The larger the variance, the more likely the groups are distinct from each other

:::

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

[Within-group]{.blue} variance 

::: {.nonincremental}

* Measures the spread of data within each group

* Considered to be the error or residual 

* Focuses on how much the values within deviate from the group's mean
